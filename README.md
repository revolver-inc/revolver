###Brief Tech rundown:

This website runs off of a technology called Gatsby and React.

React makes it easier to build big websites. Gatsby
transforms react into pure HTML which makes the site
CRAZY FAST. It does all sorts of cool optimizations in the background which give us faster speeds.

If you've reached the point where you need to make a major
change to the website and you are the new "web guy", you can see a list of the packages used to make this project in the package.json file.

List of major tech:
React
Gatsby
Styled-Components
SCSS - Most of the styling is done here.
Bootstrap Grid
Google Maps
