Edmonton's own Wares' self-titled 2017 debut album features a kaleidoscopic range of sounds from singer-songwriter Cassia Hardy. The album is a favourite of many in the local music scene. The band also tours across Canada. Wares just finished recording a new album which is slated to release next year.
