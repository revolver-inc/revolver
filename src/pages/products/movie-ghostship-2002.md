As the first movie in the U.S. to feature Emily Browning. Ghost Ship starts with an opening scene you will truly never forget. About a salvage crew who get a job to find a long-lost passenger ship rumoured to house a wealth of treasure. Ghost Ship is a somewhat forgotten gem of early 2000's horror.
