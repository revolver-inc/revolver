As the first movie in the U.S. to feature Emily Browning. Ghost Ship starts with an opening scene you will truly never forget. About a salvage crew who get a job to find a long-lost passenger ship rumoured to house a wealth of treasure. Ghost Ship is a somewhat forgotten gem of early 2000's horror. Though the opening scene is memorable the rest of the movie is your bog standard early 2000's horror movie, be that as it may.
