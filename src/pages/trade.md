tradeFAQ:
  - answer: >-
      Revolver offers the ability to trade-in your used records, cd's and movies
      for in-store credit or cash. In-store credit never expires and can be used
      freely between all of our locations!
    question: How do trades work?
  - answer: '**NO.** Credit at Revolver lasts forever.'
    question: Is there an expiry date on my credit?
  - answer: >-
      Yes we do! However, cash payouts are lower than in-store credit. So if you
      shop regularly with us, we recommend going with the in-store credit
      option.
    question: Do you give cash?

All trades are final!
