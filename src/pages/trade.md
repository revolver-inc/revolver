  - answer: >-
      Revolver offers the ability to trade-in your used records, cd's and movies
      for in-store credit or cash. In-store credit never expires and can be used
      freely between all of our locations!
    question: How do trades work?
  - answer: '**NO.** Credit at Revolver lasts forever.'
    question: Is there an expiry date on my credit?
  - answer: >-
      No, unfortunately we have to be quite selective in what we take. You would
      bring your collection down and our staff would go through what you have
      and select the items we are interested in.
    question: Do you buy entire collections?

All trades are final!
