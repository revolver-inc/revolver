tradeFAQ:
  - answer: >-
      Revolver offers the ability to trade-in your used Records, CD's, Movies
      and TV Shows for in-store credit or cash. In-store credit never expires
      and can be used freely between all of our locations! We strongly recommend
      calling ahead on the day your are planning to bring your items to ensure
      that we are able to go through them.
    question: How do trades work?
  - answer: >-
      **NO.** Credit at Revolver never expires. If you have an old credit slip
      that is falling apart, feel free to drop by one of our locations and we'll
      issue you a new one.
    question: Is there an expiry date on my credit?
  - answer: >-
      No, unfortunately we have to be quite selective in what we take. You would
      bring your collection down and our staff would go through what you have
      and select the items we are interested in.
    question: Do you buy entire collections?
  - answer: >-
      No, BUT, we strongly recommend calling ahead on the day your are planning
      to bring your items to ensure that we are able to go through them, and/or
      that we are able to do a cash payout, if preferred.
    question: Do I need an appointment?
  - answer: >-
      No. We want to make sure that any quote the we give you is accurate and
      fair. Because of that we need to physically see everything that we intend
      to buy from you. We may say no to something on a list that we do not know
      is actually something rare and valuable.
    question: Should I bring in a list of what I have?
  - answer: >-
      **YES.** Credit issued at any Revolver can be used freely between
      locations.
    question: Can I use my credit at a different location from which it was issued?
  - answer: 'Yes. We ask that you bring in a valid, government issued photo ID.'
    question: Do I need ID to trade my items?
  - answer: >-
      In order for us to issue credit or do a cash payout for any items that you
      wish to sell us you need to be at least 18 years of age.
    question: How old do I have to be to trade in my items?
